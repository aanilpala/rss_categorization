In the case of earmuffs, it also shows how a story can be reshaped over time. Chester Greenwood (1858-1937) has been cited widely as the inventor of earmuffs. Through the years, the story has been told of the young, big-eared Greenwood, who didnât like to wrap his head in itchy scarves, so on one cold day asked his grandmother to make him ear covers out of wire and cloth â and âear muffs were born.â In fact, a version of earmuffs had been devised years earlier. But when Greenwood was 19, he got a patent for his earmuffs, and the lore of his invention has become so embedded that his hometown of Farmington, Maine, celebrates Chester Greenwood Day every December with parades featuring people â and vehicles â wearing earmuffs. In McCarthyâs telling â lightened by her bright, cheerful drawings and endearingly big-eyed characters â this is less a tale of a historical wrong than a lesson in how one man unknowingly became a folk hero.

Exciting day! pic.twitter.com/tIEctHFKHG â Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 16, 2015Musk's SpaceX has been working on building resuable rockets that it says would greatly reduce the cost of space flight. Typically, rockets are burned up and discarded after one use, which the billionaire entrepreneur has said is an unnecessary waste. Previously, SpaceX has tested short launches, with rockets blasting a few hundred feet into the air before landing softly on a landing pad. But last week's mission was the first time anyone has tried landing the first stage of a rocket on a floating barge at sea. The attempt came during an unmanned mission for NASA to resupply the International Space Station with food and supplies. After a successful launch, the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket separated and then aimed for the barge, 300Â feet long by 170Â feet wide, using its engine thrust to slow down from a velocity of about 3,000Â mph. As the photos show, it hit hard and exploded.Read full article , business

Each, in his own way, represented a clear break with the earlier image of black crossover humor represented by the likes of Clarence Muse, Stepin Fetchit, Willie Best, Sam McDaniel and Mantan Moreland, who played obsequious and easily frightened servants and sidekicks in Hollywood films of the 1930s and â40s. In a sense, the black comic of the â60s was attempting two types of crossover: to bring a type of in-group, non-minstrel-tainted black humor to white audiences and to liberate black comics to do any sort of humor that suited them or that any given audience was willing to accept as funny.

Caught up in the fray is Sebastian, an ordinary house cat who changes his name to Mort(e), which means âdeathâ in French â but that âeâ in parentheses leaves open the possibility that he could be âa regular guy .â.â. who was meant for a life surrounded by loved ones.â Even as he becomes a vicious killer, Mort(e)âs overriding desire is to be reunited with Sheba, the neighborhood dog who once showed him unconditional love.

Fri, 23 Jan 2015 22:18:00 GMT, Wonkblog: No, the U.S. economy isnât about to fall into recession, Predictions are hard, especially about the future, but they're a little bit easier if you look at the yield curve. Well, most of the time, at least.Now let's back up a minute. The yield curve is just a line showing how much it costs the government to borrow from the very short to the very long-term. And it's also the best way to predict recessions. Why? Well, think about where long-term interest rates come from. They're the average of what markets expect short-term interest rates will be, plus a little extra to make up for the fact that something unexpected could happen. The longer the bond, the bigger that extra bit is, which, in part, is why the yield curve tends to be positive: shorter bonds usually have lower interest rates than longer ones.Read full article , business

The mental image of urban life is relatively anodyne, a warmly lit habitat for consumption and social bustle, but without much of an architectural profile. After decades of neglect and misguided planning, we now focus on streetscapes, walkable neighborhoods and architecture that is well-behaved, neighborly, frugal and environmentally sensitive, without much thought to the aesthetic drama of the built environment.Read full article , entertainment

Sun, 25 Jan 2015 22:45:23 GMT, Book review: In âThe Big Sevenâ by Jim Harrison, a detective behaving badly, Jim Harrisonâs new novel, published soon after his 77th birthday, is variously self-indulgent, violent, whimsical and bawdy fun. The Big Seven of his title are the seven deadly sins, which his hero, 66-year-old retired detective Simon Sunderson, has been worrying about since he was introduced to them as a lad in church. After a half-century of sinning, Sunderson judges himself innocent of envy and greed but admittedly lax in the lechery department. Harrison calls his novel a âfaux mystery,â probably because his hero spends less time solving crimes than in lusting after women. Fortunately for him, many women of all ages return the favor.Read full article , entertainment
