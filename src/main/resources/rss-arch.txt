In the case of earmuffs, it also shows how a story can be reshaped over time. Chester Greenwood (1858-1937) has been cited widely as the inventor of earmuffs. Through the years, the story has been told of the young, big-eared Greenwood, who didn’t like to wrap his head in itchy scarves, so on one cold day asked his grandmother to make him ear covers out of wire and cloth — and “ear muffs were born.” In fact, a version of earmuffs had been devised years earlier. But when Greenwood was 19, he got a patent for his earmuffs, and the lore of his invention has become so embedded that his hometown of Farmington, Maine, celebrates Chester Greenwood Day every December with parades featuring people — and vehicles — wearing earmuffs. In McCarthy’s telling — lightened by her bright, cheerful drawings and endearingly big-eyed characters — this is less a tale of a historical wrong than a lesson in how one man unknowingly became a folk hero.

Exciting day! pic.twitter.com/tIEctHFKHG — Elon Musk (@elonmusk) January 16, 2015Musk's SpaceX has been working on building resuable rockets that it says would greatly reduce the cost of space flight. Typically, rockets are burned up and discarded after one use, which the billionaire entrepreneur has said is an unnecessary waste. Previously, SpaceX has tested short launches, with rockets blasting a few hundred feet into the air before landing softly on a landing pad. But last week's mission was the first time anyone has tried landing the first stage of a rocket on a floating barge at sea. The attempt came during an unmanned mission for NASA to resupply the International Space Station with food and supplies. After a successful launch, the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket separated and then aimed for the barge, 300 feet long by 170 feet wide, using its engine thrust to slow down from a velocity of about 3,000 mph. As the photos show, it hit hard and exploded.Read full article , business

Each, in his own way, represented a clear break with the earlier image of black crossover humor represented by the likes of Clarence Muse, Stepin Fetchit, Willie Best, Sam McDaniel and Mantan Moreland, who played obsequious and easily frightened servants and sidekicks in Hollywood films of the 1930s and ’40s. In a sense, the black comic of the ’60s was attempting two types of crossover: to bring a type of in-group, non-minstrel-tainted black humor to white audiences and to liberate black comics to do any sort of humor that suited them or that any given audience was willing to accept as funny.

The White House is probably watching you back.State of the Union addresses are pretty formulaic and don't actually have much impact on public opinion, but if this year's presidential speech has anything to teach us, it's that we've come a long way from the days when the president spoke for a few minutes on TV and that was that. These days, State of the Union addresses are just as much an opportunity for the White House to study us, the voters, as it is for presidents to present a report card to Congress.Read full article , business

Critics such as Eric Hanushek, an economist at the Hoover Institution, argued these decisions were simply "throwing money at schools."  His research found that there was little correlation between how much schools spent and how well their students performed on tests.Read full article , business

His proposal to raise the top capital gains tax rate from 23.8 percent to 28 percent is generating a fair amount of attention — as my colleague Matt O'Brien put it on Friday, "money you get from investments is taxed less than money you get from, you know, actually working, and while that might be good for the economy, it's not good for a basic sense of fairness."Read full article , business

Her wail rises from a locked basement stairwell, more searching than threatening, but shrill enough to signal trouble. Later, you find her bandages hanging beside a freshly lit fire in an old cabin. On the ground outside, you read her name on a list of the experimental injections that turned her 14 year-old body into a molting monstrosity. Emphasis on details like these, which immerse players in a landslide of sensory experiences before connecting them to plot points or system rules, have defined Resident Evil games and helped make survival horror a mass market phenomenon.Read full article , entertainment

Questions of animal rights and environmental ethics play out as these newly enhanced creatures try to annihilate the human race, which had previously enslaved and domesticated them as pets and food sources. Caught up in the fray is Sebastian, an ordinary house cat who changes his name to Mort(e), which means “death” in French — but that ‘e’ in parentheses leaves open the possibility that he could be “a regular guy . . . who was meant for a life surrounded by loved ones.” Even as he becomes a vicious killer, Mort(e)’s overriding desire is to be reunited with Sheba, the neighborhood dog who once showed him unconditional love. His journey to find her, set against the backdrop of an ideological war between pure rationality and mysticism, makes for a strangely moving story.Read full article , entertainment

And when Dr. King delivered his mountaintop sermon of an “I Have a Dream” speech at the 1963 March on Washington, the young man who spoke shortly before him soaked it up, like a salve to his oft-bruised shoulders, which had weathered constant brutality in the South, so often at the hands of Bull Connor’s cops.Read full article , entertainment

Fri, 23 Jan 2015 17:25:21 GMT, Art review: ‘Architectural Image, 1920-1950’, It’s curious that today, with many cities thriving once again and young people flocking to urban enclaves, “the city” doesn’t conjure much in the visual imagination.

After decades of neglect and misguided planning, we now focus on streetscapes, walkable neighborhoods and architecture that is well-behaved, neighborly, frugal and environmentally sensitive, without much thought to the aesthetic drama of the built environment.Read full article , entertainment

George’s have seen the housing crisis erode their wealth, African Americans for decades flocked to Prince George’s County to be part of a phenomenon that has been rare in American history: a community that grew more upscale as it became more black. The Maryland county became a national symbol of the American Dream with a black twist. Families moved into expansive new homes, with rolling lawns, nearby golf courses and, most of all, neighbors who looked like them. In the early 2000s, home prices soared — some well beyond $1 million — allowing many African Americans to build the kind of wealth their elders could only imagine.Read full article , business

Sun, 25 Jan 2015 22:45:23 GMT, Book review: In ‘The Big Seven’ by Jim Harrison, a detective behaving badly, Jim Harrison’s new novel, published soon after his 77th birthday, is variously self-indulgent, violent, whimsical and bawdy fun. The Big Seven of his title are the seven deadly sins, which his hero, 66-year-old retired detective Simon Sunderson, has been worrying about since he was introduced to them as a lad in church. After a half-century of sinning, Sunderson judges himself innocent of envy and greed but admittedly lax in the lechery department. Harrison calls his novel a “faux mystery,” probably because his hero spends less time solving crimes than in lusting after women. Fortunately for him, many women of all ages return the favor.Read full article , entertainment
