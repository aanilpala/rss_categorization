In a sense  the black comic of the ’60s was attempting two types of crossover: to bring a type of in-group  non-minstrel-tainted black humor to white audiences and to liberate black comics to do any sort of humor that suited them or that any given audience was willing to accept as funny.

Previously  SpaceX has tested short launches  with rockets blasting a few hundred feet into the air before landing softly on a landing pad. But last week's mission was the first time anyone has tried landing the first stage of a rocket on a floating barge at sea. The attempt came during an unmanned mission for NASA to resupply the International Space Station with food and supplies. After a successful launch  the first stage of the Falcon 9 rocket separated and then aimed for the barge  300 feet long by 170 feet wide  using its engine thrust to slow down from a velocity of about 3 000 mph. As the photos show  it hit hard and exploded.Read full article ,business)

Questions of animal rights and environmental ethics play out as these newly enhanced creatures try to annihilate the human race  which had previously enslaved and domesticated them as pets and food sources. Caught up in the fray is Sebastian  an ordinary house cat who changes his name to Mort(e)  which means “death” in French — but that ‘e’ in parentheses leaves open the possibility that he could be “a regular guy . . . who was meant for a life surrounded by loved ones.” Even as he becomes a vicious killer  Mort(e)’s overriding desire is to be reunited with Sheba  the neighborhood dog who once showed him unconditional love. His journey to find her  set against the backdrop of an ideological war between pure rationality and mysticism  makes for a strangely moving story.Read full article ,entertainment)
