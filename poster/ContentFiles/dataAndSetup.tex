\begin{center} \textbf{\huge Data \& Setup} \end{center}
For our evaluation purposes of classifying streamed text data we are using RSS feeds from BCC. An RSS feed is a collection of tags in xml structure which contains tags for title, a description and an url among other tags. Only those listed are used in our application. Our data points are constructed from title and description of the feed, the URL gives us the respective label. Furthermore we are using Apache Spark for parallel execution of streaming and data classification. The machine learning library of Spark, MLlib, provides us with a Naive Bayes Classifier.
