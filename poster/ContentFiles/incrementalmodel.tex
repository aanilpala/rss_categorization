\begin{center} \textbf{\huge Incremental Model} \end{center}
In the incremental model, unlike the other update models, following an initial training-only phase, all the incoming stream items are always used for training right after the prediction. So, this way the immidiate information whether the prediction was good or bad can be used for improving the model on the fly. In other words, predictive model building and testin phases perfectly overlap in incremental model update method. We used this to achieve a real-time response to the changes in the data arguably making the text mining application more resillant to the conceptual drifts. The initial traing size of 600 is used for this model update method.
