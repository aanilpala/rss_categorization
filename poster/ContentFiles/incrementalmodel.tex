\begin{center} In the incremental model, unlike the other update models, following an initial training-only phase, all the incoming stream items are always used for training right after the prediction. So, this way the immediate information whether the prediction was good or bad can be used for improving the model on the fly. In other words, predictive model building and testing phases perfectly overlap in incremental model update method. Updating the model is done by 'dampening' the feature vectors of the past elements. We used incremental model to achieve a real-time response to the changes in the data arguably making the text mining application more resilient to the conceptual drifts........ \end{center}
