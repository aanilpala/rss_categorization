\begin{center} \textbf{\huge Motivation \& Problem Statement} \end{center}
Many practical applications rely on immidiate data. The need for solutions to continously conduct analyses as mathmatical computations on large data amounts led to new technologies in the past years. Stream processing operates on real-time data for example through stream windowing and analitical operations within those. Since data distributions might not remain static over time a precomputed (batch) model for analysis can produce poorly results after some time. The reconstruction or updating of the underlying analytical model to receive accurate results is required. This problem is known as Concept Drift. In this project we are using unstructured streaming data from BBC RSS feeds in order to classify them to their coresponding category. We focuss on the evaluation of a Na\"ive Bayes Classifier with different model-update approaches to compare their analytical performance according to Concept Drift.
